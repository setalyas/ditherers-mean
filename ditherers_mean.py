"""To take the dithererâ€™s mean of n numbers, we want an iterative process
that gives us n numbers at each step. So at each step, we replace the
smallest number from the previous list of numbers with the geometric mean
of the previous numbers and the largest number with the arithmetic mean of
the numbers. - Evelyn Lamb"""
