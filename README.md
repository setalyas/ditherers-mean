# Calculating the ditherers' mean
The ditherer's mean is an extension of the arithmetic-geometric mean, as [defined by Evelyn Lamb](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/the-ditherers-mean/):

> To take the dithererâ€™s mean of n numbers, we want an iterative process that gives us n numbers at each step. So at each step, we replace the smallest number from the previous list of numbers with the geometric mean of the previous numbers and the largest number with the arithmetic mean of the numbers.

Who knows if it's useful!
